3. **Use Cases**: Real-world applications or scenarios where the concept is applied.
4. **Challenges & Best Practices**: Highlight common issues and provide solutions to overcome them.

1. **Analyzing the Query**: It identifies key terms and the intent behind the request.
2. **Retrieving Relevant Information**: It searches for accurate and relevant IT-related data.
3. **Structuring the Response**: The answer is formatted in a clear and structured manner, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding.
