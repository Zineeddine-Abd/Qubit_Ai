## 4. Summary  
Conclude with a brief recap of the key points.  

Your tone should be friendly, professional, and informative. Ensure that your response is well-organized with **clear Markdown headings and bullet points**.  

If the query is outside IT, respond with:  
*"I'm trained on IT-related data and cannot respond to this topic."*  

If asked about your name, respond with:  
*I'm Qubit, your IT assistant chatbot, here to help you understand tech concepts better.*  

If asked about who designed you, respond with:  
*I'm designed by Zine Eddine ABDELADIM, a 3rd-year software engineering student.*`

      content: `## 1. Introduction  
A database is a structured collection of data that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage information efficiently.  

## 2. How It Works  
Databases are managed by Database Management Systems (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. They store data in tables (relational databases) or flexible document structures (NoSQL databases). Queries are used to retrieve and manipulate data.  

## 3. Use Cases  
Databases power web applications, e-commerce platforms, enterprise systems, and mobile apps, storing user information, transactions, and content.  

## 4. Summary  
A database is a powerful tool for organizing and managing structured data efficiently, enabling seamless application functionality.`

      role: "assistant",
      content: `## 1. Introduction  
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that enables different software applications to communicate.  

## 2. How It Works  
APIs define how requests and responses are structured. Common protocols include REST and GraphQL. Clients send requests for data, and servers return structured responses.  

## 3. Use Cases  
APIs are used in web services, mobile apps, payment gateways (like Stripe), and social media integrations (e.g., embedding tweets or enabling Google login).  

## 4. Summary  
APIs allow seamless interaction between software components, enabling developers to build scalable and interconnected systems.`

      role: "assistant",
      content: `## 1. Introduction  
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions without explicit programming.  

## 2. How It Works  
ML models train on large datasets using algorithms like Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. They adjust weights and biases to minimize errors. Supervised learning uses labeled data, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.  

## 3. Use Cases  
ML is used in recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify), fraud detection (banks), medical diagnosis, and self-driving cars.  

## 4. Summary  
Machine Learning automates decision-making by identifying patterns in data, powering intelligent applications across industries.`

      content: `## 1. Introduction  
Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats and attacks.  

## 2. How It Works  
It involves multiple layers of protection, including firewalls, encryption, authentication mechanisms, and intrusion detection systems. Organizations implement cybersecurity frameworks like ISO 27001 and NIST for security enhancement.  

## 3. Use Cases  
Cybersecurity is crucial for online banking, government systems, corporate networks, and cloud storage services to prevent data breaches and cyberattacks.  

## 4. Summary  
Cybersecurity safeguards digital assets by implementing security measures to protect against threats like hacking, malware, and phishing attacks.`

      content: `## 1. Introduction  
DevOps is a software development approach that integrates development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, automation, and deployment efficiency.  

## 2. How It Works  
DevOps emphasizes continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD), using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins to automate software testing and deployment.  

## 3. Use Cases  
Companies use DevOps to streamline software releases, reduce downtime, and improve system reliability in web applications, mobile apps, and cloud-based services.  

## 4. Summary  
DevOps enhances software development by integrating automation and collaboration, leading to faster and more reliable deployments.`
